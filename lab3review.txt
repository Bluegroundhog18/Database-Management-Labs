Correct output for some queries
Mostly correct SQL statements
SQL statements are somewhat readable

Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries instead of this
  select *
  from products where city != 'Dallas' and city != 'Duluth' and priceUSD >= 1.00;
 do it like this:
  SELECT *
  FROM products
  WHERE city != 'Dallas' 
    AND city != 'Duluth' 
    AND priceUSD >= 1;



8. List all data for orders in February less than US$500.

Incorrect output
- It seems like you did not read the correct instructions for this query. Read
  it again, please.
Correct SQL statement




In general: 

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.

- You submitted a .rtf file, which is not a text file. I had to convert your
  file to the desired format. Please check the file I created lab3.sql
