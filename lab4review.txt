4. Get the ids of customers who ordered both product p01 and p07.

Incorrect output
- You did 'p01' twice?



8. Tell me about check constraints: What are they? What are they good for? What
is the advantage of putting that sort of thing inside the database? Make up
some examples of good uses of check constraints and some examples of bad uses
of check constraints. Explain the differences in your examples and argue your
case.

- You did not include -actual- check constraints examples, just descriptions of
  them. 


In general: 

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.

- PLEASE only include your queries! You included a lot of other things. You
  droped my tables when I ran your file! I am a bit upset about that.

- Make sure your name is somewhere in the .sql file.
